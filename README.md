# National Park Services API Quiz Game
For this project, I created a quiz game based off a JSON file from the National Park services.
for this quiz, I created a place for user interaction through answering the various quiz game 
questions, looking up information about the parks, or creating a custom quiz on one of the parks.
The output of this user interaction is a quiz game that the user can play, that also shows a result
based upon how the user did.
